I am Amir, a PhD student at [George Mason University (GMU)](http://gmu.edu/) in the Dept. of Computer Science. I earned my MS in Computer Science from [GMU](http://gmu.edu/) and graduated with a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Ahsanullah University of Science & Technology (AUST)](http://aust.edu/), Dhaka, Bangladesh. My research interests include, but are not limited to, **Generative AI, Reonforcement Learning, Computer Vision and Robotics**. Currently I am working in [RobotiXX Lab](https://cs.gmu.edu/~xiao/RobotiXX/lab.html) under the supervision of [Dr. Xuesu Xiao](https://cs.gmu.edu/~xiao/). My recent projects include Social compliant navigation of autonomous robots, dexterous locomotion of legged robots in highly constrained spaces, etc.
